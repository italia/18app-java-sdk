# 18app-java-sdk
Java SDK for developing applications which accept 18app vouchers (retails and stores)

## Getting Started

To use the voucher verification service, the merchant must have one
authentication certificate to be passed to the library to authenticate.The service
"18app" can only be used by merchant with access credentials to "Servizi Telematici dellâ€™Agenzia delle Entrate".
Merchants must therefore register to the web application in order to sell their products.

This certificate X509 will be generated and downloadable in .cer format directly via
the dedicated web application for traders, in an authenticated area.
